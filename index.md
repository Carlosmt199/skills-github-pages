title: Welcome to my blog!

Really don't mind if you sit this one out.
My words but a whisper your deafness a SHOUT.
I may make you feel but I can't make you think.
Your sperm's in the gutter your love's in the sink.
So you ride yourselves over the fields
and you make all your animal deals and
your wise men don't know how it feels to be thick as a brick.
